	Steps to push local image
	Name your local images using one of these methods:
	
	    When you build them, using docker build -t <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>]
	    By re-tagging an existing local image docker tag <existing-image> <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>]
	    By using docker commit <existing-container> <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>] to commit changes
	
	Now you can push this repository to the registry designated by its name or tag.
