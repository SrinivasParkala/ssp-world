Hope this email finds you in the best of health in these difficult times.

With the whole world being paused due to the Corona virus and everything disrupted, Pride Vatika association is also facing similar circumstances.
And so, this year AGM is postponed indefinitely until a clear notification from govt on when such activity can be held.
If a virtual AGM holds validity, we will also explore the same. 
Nothing is certain yet, so based on how the situation changes we will take the appropriate action.

The association has made sure the basic maintenance of the layout is still taken care of, thanks to the effort of all working committee members, 
office Admin & our workers. Association is empowered to fulfill its purpose and carry out all the activities due to the faith and trust of members 
like you who have been supporting us for the last 3 years.

As you all know, we have already entered the new financial year and will start sending out the maintenance invoices soon for Yr 20-21.
We humbly request you all to support the association going forward too and help us in making Vatika one of the best places to live.

Thank you,

Shashivarun,
Secretary PVROWA
