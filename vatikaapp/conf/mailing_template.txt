NOTICE: 

Dear Members, stepping into the 4th year, PVROWA has decided to not increase the maintenance charges despite significant increase in Labour cost and other maitenance expenses. 
It's only with your continued support that for FY:19-20 has finally been able to maintain a siginificantly positive Balance sheet after all expenses and thus we are able to manage even with the cost rising year on year.
As a gesture of gratitude, this year we have decided to get free name boards done for sites who have been paying regularly for all 3 years.

Annual General Body meeting(AGM) date will announced based on the situation and govt directives, post lockdown. The yearly audit will be completed before the AGM. 
Hereby, for FY:20-21 we request you to clear the dues by July.

Maintenance for the current FY 2020  : Rs <CM> /-

Maintenance charges due till date	 : Rs <MF> /-

Corpus fund due till date			 : Rs <CF> /-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total								: Rs <Total> /-
